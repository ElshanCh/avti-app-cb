# **ChatBot**

## üìù**Description**
- This repository represents the development of the Chatbot with the aim to use it in the application developed by AVTI. This Chatbot is built using the ***Open-Domain Conversational ChatBot*** based on [facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill](https://huggingface.co/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill?text=Hey+my+name+is+Mariama%21+How+are+you%3F) from ü§óHugging Face and a ***Sequence Classification model with LSTM Recurrent Neural Network using PyTorch*** ([TXT_Classification_Model.ipynb](./TXT_Classification_Model.ipynb)).<br />

- Since the ***Open-Domain Conversational ChatBot*** is pre-trained on millions of conversations on Facebook it can carry on a natural conversation.
- Besides the natural conversation there was need to adapt the chatbot to company goals, for this reason there has been developed the ***Classfication Model*** with the help of which it is possible to extract the intents of the question/requests and based on each intent it is possible to perform various actions if needed.<br/>
    - The ***intent 0*** is reserved for the Blenderbot, which means that all the requests cassified as 0 will be redirected to the Facebook Blenderbot.
    - Since the Blenderbot has been pre-trained on millions of conversations on Facebook, when you ask from Bot its name it can give each time different names. For this reason the ***Intent 1*** is reserved for the name entity, which defines whether in the content of each question/request there is an intention to ask the name of the Bot. As an action to this intent a pre-defined response is assigned (*Hello! My name is AVTI. How may I help you?*)



- Another modification that has been implemented was making the ChatBot multilingual (adapting to Italian and French languages). For this purpose, the [deep-translator](https://pypi.org/project/deep-translator/#:~:text=It%20is%20100%25%20free%2C%20unlimited,famous%20translators%20in%20this%20tool) library of python gets used. <br />
    So, when the question/request from the client arrives not in English it first gets translated to English, then passes through the above mentioned models, and finally, it gets translated back to the original language before returning to the client.
